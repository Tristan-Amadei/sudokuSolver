# sudokuSolver

Application to solve any given soduko, using backtracking.
Using this, I've built a gui to play the game of sudoku : the game creates a random sudoku grid (that can be solved) and solves it in background. 
Then, allows the players to enter numbers, and checks whether the number entered is right or is a mistake.
